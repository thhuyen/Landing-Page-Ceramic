## Explaination for each page:

### 1. **The global files**
  - header.html: contains header html
  - footer.html: contains footer html
  - loadPage.js: source code to add html from a page to another page
  - passValue.js: to serve for carousel (at first I created it global because I thought it would be used again in other pages. However, just only home page uses it at the present)
  - render.js: source code to render new element to DOM. We will use it when needing render something maybe increasing volume in the future like products, sliders,..
### 2. **The local files**: 

#### 2.1 **Home**
  - The layout includes: header + slider + 3 tabs product + input to get customer's email + carousel of social media + footer.
  - Links: fontawesome (icon), themify (icon), font-family from Google Fonts, CSS.
  - Files:
    - header.html
    - footer.html
    - home.html
    - loadPage.js
    - render.js (global - assets/js/render.js)
    - render.js (assets/js/home/render.js)
    - passValue.js
    - eventHandler.js (assets/js/home/eventHandler.js): handle all event on home screen.
    - login.js
    - user.js
    - cart.js
  - The same method to make slider / carousel / tabs: I will find all items to find which is display (having active_block). Then, I remove it and add className='active_block' for current item.

#### 2.1 **LOGIN**
##### *Login Modal Box*:
- **Location**: Nested in the Header Nav Bar ( group of Icons, click in the Account Btn and it'll show up a Modal Box)
- **Usage and its function**: 
  - Help user log in (if already have an account) with the `remember me` to save infor for the next time logging in, or navigate to the Register page to help user register a new account.
  - If logging in successfully, it will navigate to the Account page (`pages/login/userInfo.html`) and user can see some private pages.
  - Should includes `user.js` and `login.js` to make sure the login function will execute properly whenever clicking in the Account button

##### *Login Page (pages/login/userInfo.html)*:
- After successfully logging in, this page will show up.
- Show account infor (username, total items selected)
- Optional navigation: Sign out or Back to Homepage
- **Related files:** :
  - `login.js`: used for event-handler for icons/buttons navigated or related to the login function.
  - `user.js` module to check if user logged in or not or to log out
  - `userLogin-loader.js`: for log out function, render user info about account, and optional render based on the status of Cart.
